    "## Precision and Recall\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember than when performing classification, our universe of observations is divided into four categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- True positives (**TP**): These are cases in which we predicted yes correctly (e.g. the email is spam, and we predicted spam).\n",
    "- True negatives (**TN**): We predicted no, and the result was no (e.g. the email is not spam, and we predicted not spam).\n",
    "- False positives (**FP**): We predicted yes, but the result was no (e.g. the email is not spam, and we predicted spam).\n",
    "- False negatives (**FN**): We predicted no, but the result was yes (e.g. the email is spam, and we predicted not spam).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use these four categories to calculate the **precision** and **recall** of a classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** is the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus the number of false positives.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$Precision = \\frac{True Positives}{True Positives + False Positives}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think: of all the times we predicted yes, how many times were we right?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall** is the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus the number of false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Recall = \\frac{True Positives}{True Positives + False Negatives}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think: What proportion of actual positives did we correctly predict?\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the situation, we may want to maximize precision or recall. There is often a tradeoff between the two. For example, if we want to minimize false positives, we can set a high threshold for predicting yes. This will increase precision, but decrease recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1 - Spam filter\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset of 1000 emails, 500 of which are spam. We have a spam filter that flags 200 emails as spam. Of the 200 emails flagged as spam, 150 are actually spam. What is the precision and recall of the spam filter?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have 150 true positives and 50 false positives. Therefore, the precision is:\n",

    "\n",
    "We also have 150 true positives and 350 false negatives. Therefore, the recall is:\n",

    "## Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional probability is the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. For example, if you are interested in the probability that it is raining outside, given that it is cloudy, you are dealing with conditional probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Probability Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The conditional probability formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $P(A|B)$ is the probability of A given B, $P(A \\cap B)$ is the probability of A and B, and $P(B)$ is the probability of B.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem is a formula that describes how to update the probabilities of hypotheses when given evidence. It follows simply from the axioms of conditional probability, but can be used to powerfully reason about a wide range of problems involving belief updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $P(A|B)$ is the probability of A given B, $P(B|A)$ is the probability of B given A, $P(A)$ is the probability of A, and $P(B)$ is the probability of B.\n",
    "\n",
    "### the law of total probability\n",
    "\n",
    "The law of total probability is a fundamental rule relating marginal probabilities to conditional probabilities. It expresses the total probability of an outcome which can be realized via several distinct events—hence the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(A) = \\sum_{i=1}^n P(A|B_i)P(B_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $P(A)$ is the probability of A, $P(A|B_i)$ is the probability of A given $B_i$, and $P(B_i)$ is the probability of $B_i$.\n"

    "## Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario I:\n",
    "We want to create a basic spam filter that determines that an email is spam given the occurrence of the word \"offer.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concepts:\n",
    "- **Spam Probability (P(Spam)):** The overall probability that an email is spam.\n",
    "- **Word Occurrence Probability:** Probability of the word \"offer\" appearing in spam and non-spam emails.\n",
    "- **Conditional Probability:** Probability that an email is spam given the occurrence of the word \"offer\" ($P(Spam | \"offer\")$).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "Suppose:\n",
    "- 30% of emails in our dataset are spam ($P(Spam) = 0.3$).\n",
    "- \"offer\" appears in 60% of spam emails ($P(offer | Spam) = 0.6$) and 10% of non-spam emails $(P(offer | ¬Spam) = 0.1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applying Bayes' Theorem:\n",
    "We want to calculate $P(Spam | \"offer\")$, the probability that an email is spam given it contains the word \"offer.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Bayes' theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(Spam | \"offer\") = \\frac{P(\"offer\" | Spam) \\times P(Spam)}{P(\"offer\")}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitute the given values and calculate the probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(Spam | \"offer\") = \\frac{0.6 \\times 0.3}{P(\"offer\")} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To find $P(\"offer\")$, use the Law of Total Probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\"offer\") = P(\"offer\" | Spam) \\times P(Spam) + P(\"offer\" | ¬Spam) \\times P(¬Spam) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\"offer\") = 0.6 \\times 0.3 + (0.1 \\times 0.7) = 0.18 + 0.07 = 0.25 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(Spam | \"offer\") = \\frac{0.6 \\times 0.3}{0.25} = 0.72 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "Given the presence of the word \"offer\" in an email, the filter predicts with approximately 72% probability that the email is spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simplified example demonstrates how Bayes' theorem can be used in spam filtering by considering the occurrence of a single word to estimate the probability of an email being spam. In real applications, more sophisticated models and multiple features are used to enhance accuracy.\n",
