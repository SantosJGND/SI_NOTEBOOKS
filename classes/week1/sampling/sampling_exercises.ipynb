    "## Law of Large Numbers - Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Law of Large Numbers (LLN) is a fundamental theorem in statistics. It states that if we repeat an experiment independently a large number of times and average the result, what we obtain should be close to the expected value. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by exploring the LNN in the context of coin tosses. We will then explore the LLN in the context of the binomial distribution. Finally, we will explore the LLN in the context of the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might remember, there is a distribution that models the expected outcome of a coin toss. This distribution is called the Bernoulli distribution, and is parametrized by a single parameter $p$ which is the probability of obtaining heads. The probability of obtaining tails is equal to $1-p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Simulating coin tosses\n",
    "\n",
    "We will simulate coin tosses in python using the `sample()` function from the `random` package. This function takes two arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import random\n",
    "population = [\"H\", \"T\"]\n",
    "k = 1\n",
    "random.sample(population, k)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first argument of the `sample()` function is the vector of possible outcomes. The second argument is the number of times we want to sample from this vector. In this case, we only want to sample once. The output of this function is a vector of length 1 containing either \"H\" or \"T\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulate a single coin toss using the `sample()` function. "

    "The binomial distribution describes the behaviour of sampling repeatedly from a Bernoulli distribution. In this way, a single draw from the binomial distribition, already describes a case in which the LLN applies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the parameters of the binomial distribution are $n$ and $p$. The parameter $n$ is the number of times we sample from the Bernoulli distribution. The parameter $p$ is the probability of obtaining heads in a single draw from the Bernoulli distribution.\n",

    "The LLN also applies of course to the binomial distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you might be tempted to wonder: What good is this, since we can just increase the sample size (e.g. the number of coin tosses) to approximate the expected value of the binomial distribution?\n",

    "Reflect on this question for a moment. What do you think?\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact is that in real world scenarios you might be limited in sample size. For example, you might be limited by time, money, or other resources. In these cases, it is useful to know that the LLN applies to the binomial distribution. This means that if you repeat the experiment a large number of times, you will obtain a good approximation of the expected value of the binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also true that in some cases you might not be able to repeat your experiment and are stuck with a single sample. In this case, given that you know the sample size, you can at least compute the variance of the sample. This will give you an idea of how much the sample mean might vary if you were to repeat the experiment.\n",
